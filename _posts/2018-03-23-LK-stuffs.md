About my recent founds :)

found & posted by [zer0day](https://kozistr.github.io/)

## tl;dr

I found a bug, memory leak on v4.16.0-rc5. (KASLR Bypass). Maybe, it works on many LKs (i didn't check all of them yet).

(Of course, it's not kptr_restrict stuff :))

Except this, there're some bugs, also memleak. But i didn't make them into useful codes :).
